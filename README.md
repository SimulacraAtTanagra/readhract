## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program parses a procedurally created user guide in order to capture its data for other programmatic use.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
Due to the existence of this guide, which lays out all of the acceptable Action/Reason combinations and business reasons for their use, in a format that is not friendly to programming, and my own failure to ask for it in a different format, the most convenient option was to parse it myself rather than sending an embarassing e-mail. Also, I get to show off a bit.
## This project leverages the following libraries:
pandas, PyPDF2
## In order to use this, you'll first need do the following:
The only thing the user would need is the guide, which they can find by googling the filename in the code.
## The expected frequency for running this code is as follows:
